# Checkpoint Snapshot Test Scenario
# Tests: manual checkpoint creation, restore to checkpoint
#
# Expected flow:
# 1. Start session, run baseline, accept target
# 2. Apply first tuning, run benchmark
# 3. Create checkpoint 'good-memory'
# 4. Apply more tuning, run benchmark
# 5. Results worse, restore to checkpoint
# 6. Continue from checkpoint state

# Start with default strategy
/go

# Run baseline
/run

# Accept target
/accept

# Apply first round (memory tuning)
/apply

# Run benchmark - expect improvement
/run

# Save this good state as checkpoint
/snapshot good-memory

# Apply second round (more aggressive tuning)
/apply

# Run benchmark - might be worse
/run

# Results didn't improve, restore to good checkpoint
/restore good-memory

# Exit
/quit

# Basic Snapshot/Restore Test Scenario
# Tests: automatic initial snapshot, restore to initial
#
# Expected flow:
# 1. Start session with default strategy
# 2. Run baseline benchmark
# 3. Accept target
# 4. Apply first tuning (auto-creates initial snapshot)
# 5. Run benchmark
# 6. List snapshots (should show 'initial')
# 7. Dry-run restore (preview changes)
# 8. Restore to initial state
# 9. Exit

# Start with default strategy
/go

# Run baseline benchmark
/run

# Accept suggested target
/accept

# Apply first tuning round
# This should auto-create 'initial' snapshot
/apply

# Run benchmark to see improvement
/run

# Verify snapshot was created
/snapshot list

# Preview what restore would change
/restore --dry-run

# Actually restore to initial state
/restore

# Exit session
/quit

# Snapshot Comparison Test Scenario
# Tests: comparing snapshots to see differences
#
# Expected flow:
# 1. Start session, run baseline
# 2. Apply first tuning, create checkpoint
# 3. Apply second tuning, create checkpoint
# 4. Compare initial vs first checkpoint
# 5. Compare first vs second checkpoint

# Start session
/go

# Run baseline
/run

# Accept target
/accept

# Apply first round
/apply

# Run benchmark
/run

# Create first checkpoint
/snapshot after-round-1

# Apply second round
/apply

# Run benchmark
/run

# Create second checkpoint
/snapshot after-round-2

# Compare initial vs after-round-1
/snapshot compare initial after-round-1

# Compare after-round-1 vs after-round-2
/snapshot compare after-round-1 after-round-2

# Show snapshot details
/snapshot show initial
/snapshot show after-round-1

# Exit
/quit
